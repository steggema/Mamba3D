# Fork of official Mamba3D repository with updates to more recent versions of pytorch, CUDA, and some other packages

Changes
- Updated to CUDA 12.1 and corresponding conda pytorch install (following pytorch installation guidelines along the lines of ```conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=12.1 -c pytorch -c nvidia```)
- Updated to python 3.11 (note 3.12 does not seem to work)
- Update to Pointnet: Fetch code from here https://github.com/evenrose/Pointnet2_PyTorch.git, then install (in directory) with ```pip install pointnet2_ops_lib/```

Additional pip installs compared to main instructions below:
```
pip install causal-conv1d # Note no version
pip install openTSNE
pip install fvcore
pip install mmcv-full
pip install thop
pip install mamba-ssm
```

Below is the original README.

This repository contains the official implementation of the paper:

[**[ACM MM 24] Mamba3D: Enhancing Local Features for 3D Point Cloud Analysis via State Space Model**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14966)


## ðŸ“° News
- [2024/8] We've slightly optimized the architecture, such as some normalization layers and hyperparameters.
- [2024/8] We release the training and evaluation code! Pretrained weights are coming soon!
- [2024/7] Our [MiniGPT-3D](https://github.com/tangyuan96/minigpt-3d) is also accepted by ACM MM24! We outperform existing large point-language models, using just about 1 day on 1 RTX 3090! Check it out!
- [2024/7] Ours Mamba3D is accepted by ACM MM24!

- [2024/4] We present Mamba3D, a state space model tailored for point cloud learning.
